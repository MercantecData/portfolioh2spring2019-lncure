Abstract classes can be explained like blueprints, it's a class that's
incomplete, showing only the functionality of the class whilst hiding internal details.

Some small details about Abstract classes is that they cannot be instantiated and they have no body
to be utilized either. You could say that these Abstract classes are quite lacking.

Abstract classes can be defined like so:

Public abstract void test();

The class is abstract once defined with the 'Abstract' Modifier.

Abstract classes are primarily used for inheritances of different elements.
This is primarily because of safety reasons.

Couldn't find much else regarding Abstract classes, it just goes to show that if you require
an effective method of inheriting classes, then abstract classes is the way to go.
